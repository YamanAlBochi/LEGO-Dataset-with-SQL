In this Project, I go through the data model of the Rebrick able LEGO Dataset and then create a database for analytics. First, I go through real scenarios of answering questions about data with SQL. then I perform some basic SQL queries to exploring complex problems using JOINS, CTEs, and WINDOW functions


1- Creating a Database in SQL Server

2- Two different methods of Importing Files into a Database

3- SQL Joins

4- SQL Window Functions
